### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a computer science major at Williams College, graduating in December 2022. I have experience working in fast-paced startup environments and experience developing [operating](https://github.com/jaes16/OS_Dev) and [file systems](https://github.com/jaes16/FS). I'm currently open to any opportunities in the industry, please don't hesistate to reach out on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jae-mahn-surh-703/).

&nbsp;


Please check out my systems projects, lots more info in the readme for those projects.

I also use [stock_scrape](https://github.com/jaes16/stock_scrape) to get a lot of interesting headlines for the day. I find just getting headlines from better outlets is better than total articles from more affordable outlets, as I can research them on my own. Also interesting to get FOMC statements.

Some of my paintings are in this [link](https://jaes16.github.io).
